# Deployment Logs - October 21, 2025
## Goal: Get DAWN Deployed to Render (Two-Phase Approach)

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY GOAL
**Get DAWN live on Render with working tool calling, then add auth incrementally**

**Why This Approach:**
- Current all-at-once deployment failing with unclear errors
- Too many moving parts to debug simultaneously
- Need to isolate deployment issues from auth issues
- Prove core functionality works before adding security layer

---

## 📋 PHASE 1: Bare Bones Deployment (30 minutes)

### Goal
Deploy working DAWN to Render WITHOUT authentication:
- ✅ Next.js app builds successfully
- ✅ Health check endpoint works
- ✅ Chat API functional
- ✅ Azure OpenAI integration working
- ✅ Tool calling operational
- ✅ n8n webhooks trigger

### What We're Temporarily Removing
1. **middleware.ts** - Route protection (entire file)
2. **Auth check in chat API** - Authentication requirement
3. **Auth imports** - NextAuth dependencies in API routes
4. **Audit logging** - User email tracking (no session to get email from)

### What Stays
- ✅ render.yaml deployment config
- ✅ next.config.mjs production settings
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Chat API route (core functionality)
- ✅ Tool definitions and handlers
- ✅ Azure OpenAI integration
- ✅ All UI components

### Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Disable Route Protection (2 min)
```bash
# Rename middleware.ts so it's not active
mv middleware.ts middleware.ts.DISABLED
```

#### Step 2: Remove Auth from Chat API (5 min)
**File: `app/api/chat/route.ts`**
- Remove auth import
- Remove session check
- Remove userEmail variable
- Remove audit logging calls (they need userEmail)
- Keep all core chat + tool calling logic

#### Step 3: Test Build Locally (5 min)
```bash
npm run build
```
- Must succeed before pushing
- Fix any TypeScript errors
- Verify no missing dependencies

#### Step 4: Commit & Push (2 min)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Temporary: Remove auth for initial deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 5: Monitor Render Build (5 min)
- Watch build logs in Render dashboard
- Should complete successfully
- Note any errors if they occur

#### Step 6: Test Live Deployment (10 min)
Once deployed:
1. Visit app URL: `https://tfc-agent-oct20th-25.onrender.com`
2. Should see DAWN interface immediately (no login)
3. Test: "Hello DAWN"
4. Test: "Update Reyna Vargas status to Waitlist"
5. Test: "Add a note saying test deployment successful"
6. Test: "Search for active clients"
7. Verify tool calls work in Render logs

#### Success Criteria for Phase 1
- [ ] Render build completes without errors
- [ ] App loads in browser
- [ ] Can send messages to DAWN
- [ ] DAWN responds with streaming text
- [ ] Tool calling works (check Render logs)
- [ ] n8n webhooks trigger successfully

---

## 📋 PHASE 2: Add Authentication Back (1 hour)

### Goal
Re-enable authentication incrementally while keeping app working

### Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Re-enable Middleware (5 min)
```bash
mv middleware.ts.DISABLED middleware.ts
```
- Test locally
- Commit & push
- Verify still deploys

#### Step 2: Add Auth Check to Chat API (10 min)
- Add auth import back
- Add session check (return 401 if not authenticated)
- Test locally with mock session
- Commit & push

#### Step 3: Set Up Azure AD (15 min)
- Create app registration in Azure Portal
- Get client ID, tenant ID, client secret
- Add to Render environment variables

#### Step 4: Add Audit Logging Back (10 min)
- Re-enable audit log calls
- Use session.user.email
- Test locally
- Commit & push

#### Step 5: Test Full Authentication Flow (20 min)
1. Visit live app
2. Should redirect to /auth/signin
3. Click "Sign in with Microsoft"
4. Complete Azure AD auth
5. Should land on DAWN interface
6. Test all functionality
7. Check audit logs in Render

#### Success Criteria for Phase 2
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to signin
- [ ] Azure AD login works
- [ ] Authenticated users can use DAWN
- [ ] Audit logs capture user email
- [ ] Session persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Auto-logout after 8 hours

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Phase 1 Build Fails
**Check:**
1. View actual error in Render logs
2. Verify package-lock.json is clean
3. Try build locally first: `npm run build`
4. Check for TypeScript errors
5. Verify all imports are correct

**Common Issues:**
- Missing dependencies → Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- TypeScript errors → Check removed imports aren't referenced
- Build timeout → Increase Render timeout in dashboard

### If Phase 1 Deploys But Doesn't Work
**Check:**
1. Render logs for runtime errors
2. Browser console for frontend errors
3. Test health endpoint: `/api/health`
4. Verify environment variables set in Render
5. Check Azure OpenAI credentials

### If Phase 2 Auth Doesn't Work
**Check:**
1. Azure AD redirect URI matches exactly
2. Environment variables set correctly
3. Client secret hasn't expired
4. User is in correct Azure AD tenant
5. Clear browser cookies and retry

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Two-Phase Deployment**
- Rationale: Too complex to debug all-at-once deployment
- Trade-off: Temporary security gap (no auth)
- Mitigation: Phase 1 should take < 30 minutes

**Decision 2: Keep Tool Calling in Phase 1**
- Rationale: Need to prove core functionality works
- Benefit: Can test actual use case immediately
- Risk: Minimal, tool calling already working locally

**Decision 3: Remove Audit Logging in Phase 1**
- Rationale: Requires user session (not available without auth)
- Trade-off: No compliance logging temporarily
- Mitigation: Add back in Phase 2 before production use
