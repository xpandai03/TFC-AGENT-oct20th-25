# Excel Preview Feature - Progress Log

## 🎉 SUCCESS - Preview is Rendering!

### What's Working ✅
1. **Tool Calling** - AI correctly calls `showExcelPreview` when asked to show spreadsheet
2. **Preview Component** - ExcelPreview.jsx renders perfectly with:
   - Clean header with "Excel Spreadsheet Preview" title
   - Reason display ("User requested to see spreadsheet")
   - Live SharePoint iframe embedding the Excel file
   - Expand/collapse button (maximize/minimize)
   - X button to dismiss
   - Footer with "Live view from SharePoint • Changes update in real-time"
3. **AI Response** - Clean text response without JSON echo
4. **Visual Display** - Spreadsheet shows correctly in iframe

### Screenshot Evidence
- User asked: "can u please show me the excel spreadsheet?"
- AI responded: "Here's the spreadsheet as you requested. If you need any specific information or further assistance, just let me know!"
- Excel preview component rendered below with live spreadsheet

## ❌ ISSUE - Subsequent Messages Fail

### Error Behavior
- After Excel preview is displayed, sending the next message causes an error
- User sent: "awesome job what else can u do"
- AI error response: "Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting right now. Please try again in a moment."

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurs when preparing conversation history for the next API call.

**Problem Location:** `components/AIAssistantUI.jsx` around lines 310-314

```javascript
const historyForAPI = conversationHistory.map((msg) => ({
  role: msg.role,
  content: msg.content,
}))
```

**Issue:**
- Excel preview messages have structure: `{type: 'excel_preview', excelPreview: {...}}`
- They don't have a regular `content` field
- When mapping to `historyForAPI`, this creates invalid messages
- API rejects the malformed history and returns error

### Solution Required
Filter out Excel preview messages when building conversation history:

```javascript
const historyForAPI = conversationHistory
  .filter((msg) => msg.type !== 'excel_preview') // Skip Excel preview messages
  .map((msg) => ({
    role: msg.role,
    content: msg.content,
  }))
```

**Rationale:**
- Excel preview messages are UI-only components
- They don't contain conversation context the AI needs
- Filtering them prevents malformed history from breaking subsequent messages
- The AI's text response about the preview IS included (it's a regular message)

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `sendMessage` function in AIAssistantUI.jsx
2. Filter out `type === 'excel_preview'` messages before mapping to API format
3. Test full conversation flow:
   - Show spreadsheet → works
   - Send follow-up message → should work
   - Continue conversation → should work

## Files Modified So Far

### Backend
- `lib/tools/definitions.ts` - Added showExcelPreview tool
- `lib/tools/executors.ts` - Created executeShowExcelPreview function
- `lib/agent/tool-handler.ts` - Added showExcelPreview case
